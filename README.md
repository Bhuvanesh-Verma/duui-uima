# duui-uima

This repository contains implemented NLP tools, which can be used as images withhin the [Docker Unified UIMA Interface](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/DockerUnifiedUIMAInterface) (DUUI).

The individual repositories contain a description of each image as well as its used tool. Since the containers all run independently, they encapsulate different models and use different programming languages in their implementation.

The images in each repository can be modified and then built yourself and then used with DUUI; alternatively, a link with an existing DUUI image is available in each repository.

  abstract  = {Automatic analysis of large corpora is a complex task, especially
               in terms of time efficiency. This complexity is increased by the
               fact that flexible, extensible text analysis requires the continuous
               integration of ever new tools. Since there are no adequate frameworks
               for these purposes in the field of NLP, and especially in the
               context of UIMA, that are not outdated or unusable for security
               reasons, we present a new approach to address the latter task:
               Docker Unified UIMA Interface (DUUI), a scalable, flexible, lightweight,
               and feature-rich framework for automatic distributed analysis
               of text corpora that leverages Big Data experience and virtualization
               with Docker. We evaluate DUUI{'}s communication approach against
               a state-of-the-art approach and demonstrate its outstanding behavior
               in terms of time efficiency, enabling the analysis of big text
               data.}
