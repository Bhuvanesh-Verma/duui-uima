# duui-uima

This repository contains implemented NLP tools, which can be used as images withhin the [Docker Unified UIMA Interface](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/DockerUnifiedUIMAInterface) (DUUI).

The individual repositories contain a description of each image as well as its used tool. Since the containers all run independently, they encapsulate different models and use different programming languages in their implementation.

The images in each repository can be modified and then built yourself and then used with DUUI; alternatively, a link with an existing DUUI image is available in each repository.
